# Flickr VR Viewer

Search Flickr's 360 degree photo group and display photos in A-FRAME skybox. Works in VR headset or on phone with Google cardboard etc. Look at feet to open keyboard, use gaze controls to input search.

Use npm start / npm build to start / build respectively.

TODO:
* Add search results component
* Ensure keyboard appears in the correct place (on some devices it's currently appearing behind user instead of in front)
* Improve gaze controls
